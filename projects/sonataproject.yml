    The goal of the Sonata Project is to provide a set of high-level
    features built on top of the Symfony framework, with a strong focus on
    administration backends.
    Think of it as a toolkit based on Symfony components to make building
    sites easy and fun!
    Famous bundles are already available: Admin Bundle, Block Bundle, Media
    Bundle, ... and used by other projects like the Symfony CMF.
    Most bundles are focused on providing CMS and e-commerce solutions, but
    there are also fairly independent bundles like the Notification Bundle
    or the Seo Bundle or even libraries like the cache library or the
    exporter library.

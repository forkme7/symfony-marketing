    Roadiz is a modern CMS based on a polymorphic node system which can
    handle many types of services and contents. Its back-office has been
    developed with a high sense of design and user experience. Its theming
    system is built to live independently from back-office allowing easy
    switching and multiple themes for one content basis. For example, it
    allows you to create one theme for your desktop website and another one
    for your mobile, using the same node hierarchy. Roadiz is released under
    MIT license, so you can reuse and distribute its code for personal and
    commercial projects.

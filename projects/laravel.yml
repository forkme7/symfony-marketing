    Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant
    syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative
    experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain
    out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web
    projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

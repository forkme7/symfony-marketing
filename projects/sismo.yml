    Sismo is a Continuous Testing Server written in PHP. Sismo does not try
    to do more than getting your code, running your tests, and send you
    notifications. Sismo is language and tool agnostic. Just give it a
    command that knows how to run your tests and returns a non-zero exit
    code when tests do not pass. Sounds good? There is more. Sismo is
    insanely easy to install (there is only one PHP file to download), easy
    to configure, and it comes with a gorgeous web interface.

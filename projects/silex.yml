    Silex is a PHP microframework built on the shoulders of Symfony and Pimple
    and also inspired by Sinatra. A microframework provides the guts for
    building simple single-file apps. Silex aims to be: concise (it exposes an
    intuitive and concise API that is fun to use), extensible (it has an
    extension system based around the Pimple micro service-container that makes
    it even easier to tie in third party libraries) and testable (it uses
    Symfony's HttpKernel, which abstracts request and response and simplifies
    app testing).

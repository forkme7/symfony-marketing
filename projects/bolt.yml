    Bolt is a tool for Content Management, which strives to be as simple
    and straightforward as possible. It is quick to set up, easy to
    configure, uses elegant templates, and above all: It's a joy to use.
    Bolt is created using modern open source libraries, and is best suited
    to build sites in HTML5 with modern markup.

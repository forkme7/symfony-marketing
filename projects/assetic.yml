    Assetic is an asset management framework for PHP. It combines two
    major ideas: assets and filters. The assets are files such as CSS,
    JavaScript and image files. The filters are things that can be applied
    to these files before they are served to the browser. This allows a
    separation between the asset files stored in the application and the
    files actually presented to the user.

    Deptrac is a static code analysis tool that helps to enforce rules for
    dependencies between software layers. For example, you can define a rule like
    "controllers may not depend on models". To ensure this, deptrac analyzes
    your code to find any usages of models in your controllers and will show you
    where this rule was violated.

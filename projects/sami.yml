    Sami is an API documentation generator. It uses a PHP file for
    configuration to give a very flexible way of tweaking the API
    generation, Twig for templating and a dependency injection container
    (Pimple) to let you override any internal class. It only works with
    PHP 5.3 (but it can generate documentation for PHP 5.2 projects). It
    uses the excellent PHP Parser project for PHP code parsing. You can
    also manage versions of your code to generate documentation for all of
    them in a single tree (without the overhead of re-parsing everything
    for each version of course).

    The OroPlatform is an Open source Business Application Platform (BAP).
    It offers developers the exact business application platform they've
    been looking for, by combining the tools they need. Built in PHP and
    the Symfony framework, it seamlessly integrates into OroCRM and OroCommerce 
    or works entirely standalone. Developing custom business applications has 
    never been so easy.

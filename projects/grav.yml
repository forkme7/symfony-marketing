    Grav is a Modern, Fast, Simple and Flexible flat-file CMS. While Grav is
    intentionally minimal, the extensive plugin architecture allows it to be
    adapt to almost any task. Powerful Twig templating ensures that
    development is only limited by your imagination. Sophisticated caching
    mechanisms mean that Grav is scary fast and can scale more than other
    flat-file CMS systems. Utilizing Markdown for content creation and YAML
    for  configuration ensures it is always easy to use and configure.
    Being flat-file  based, means a Grav site is quick to install, simple to
    migrate, and a breeze  to version.

    Ladybug provides an easy and extensible var_dump / print_r replacement
    for PHP 5.3+ projects. Any PHP variable, object or resource can be
    dumped to a beautiful representation in HTML, CLI or text. It is highly
    customizable and extensible as the plugin system allows to include
    third-party themes or class inspectors. There is a bundle to use it in
    Symfony projects, which adds some extra features such as dumping to the
    profiler.

    Behat is an open source behavior-driven development framework for PHP
    5.3 and 5.4. What is behavior-driven development, you ask? It's the
    idea that you start by writing human-readable sentences that describe
    a feature of your application and how it should work, and only then
    implement this behavior in software.

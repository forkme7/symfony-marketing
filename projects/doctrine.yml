description: |
    Object relational mapper (ORM) for PHP that sits on top of a powerful
    database abstraction layer (DBAL). One of its key features is the
    option to write database queries in a proprietary object oriented SQL
    dialect called Doctrine Query Language (DQL), inspired by Hibernates
    HQL. This provides developers with a powerful alternative to SQL that
    maintains flexibility without requiring unnecessary code duplication.
